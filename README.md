Computational Practice Homework 1

I changed the bubbles to appear from a radius of 1 to 150, changed the x and y movement to -20 to 20, and changed the bubble color (and hover color) to blue.

I also made bubbles appear when clicking on the background. To do this I added the variable mouseWasPressed, and made it so that when thw mouse is clicked, it checked whether or not it was on a bubble. If it was, it would set mouseWasPressed to false and do nothing.
